\title{Infectious Bite for Human to Vector Transmission}
\usage{
infectMosquito_PfSI(ixH, t, ixS)
}
\arguments{
\item{ixH}{index of human}

\item{t}{time of bite (local time of mosquito)}

\item{ixS}{index of feeding site}
}
\value{
a named list
\itemize{
\item infected: TRUE or FALSE depending on human infection status and transmisson efficiency
\item PfM: if transmisson successful, the pathogen object passed to the mosquito
}

\description{
This function handles human to vector transmission for the PfSI module and is called from \code{getInfected()} defined in MBITES-HostEncounter.R.
If the human has an active infection and there is a successful bloodstream to mosquito transfer of gametocytes a \code{PfM} object is made by \code{makePfM()}
and is passed to the mosquito.
