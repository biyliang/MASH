# naming conventions
HUMANS/MICRO/MACRO/PATHOGEN/INTERVENTION - Human/HumanPop/Mosquito/MosquitoPop/PfSI/Site/Tile/Emerge,etc - Class/Parameters/Main/Auxiliary.R

# humans for PfSI
before making any objects, run PfSI.Setup()
then run SimBitePfSI.Setup()

to initialize first make the HumanPop object then for PfSI you will need to run PfSI.Init(PfPR = XX) on your object.


# other conventions:
* never initialize pointers in the $new() or initialize() functions; initialize after with their setter function $set_POINTER()
* XX.Init are methods added to OBJECTS already in the environment
* XX.Setup are FUNCTIONS called before any OBJECTS are created.
* .Init,.Setup,.Parameters are the only times that period may be used to define thing.
* when a setter needs to take the object and an index, go set_XX(obj, ix = NULL){...}

# dave MACRO to sean R6 MACRO name changes
* w = biteWeight
* ixTrip = ixP (its in the PAR list so its not ambiguous)
* PfTypes = patchPf

# files that directly set methods/fields without prompting (not in a .SETUP function)
* MACRO-MosquitoPop-Methods.R
* MACRO-Patch-Methods.R
